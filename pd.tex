\section{Pairwise Disagreement Loss}\label{sec:pdloss}

\cite{duchi} studies consistency of pdloss. They show two widely used surrogates are not generally consistent. Then they gives low.noise condition on the probability distribution under which we can have calibrated surrogate loss. \cite{ramaswamy2013convex} generalizes low.noise condition and provides another more general condition and surrogate loss.
