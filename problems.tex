\section{Variations of Ranking and Other Problems}\label{sec:problems}
In this section, we give an overview of some problems we considered in the
course of the project, motivated by papers we were reading~\cite{}. 

One direction was along ranking. In the ranking problem, the prediction space
is the set of permutations, which one can think of as the set of total orders.
We considered generalizing this to partial orders with possibly some
restriction, and identified task scheduling as an application domain.
We outline how ranking algorithms may be applied to solve some
problems in these domains.

Another direction was along online expert advice.
TODO.

These are discussed in the sections below.
