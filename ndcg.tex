\section{NDCG}
\label{sec:ndcg}
If the algorithm is to output a scoring function and has access to relevance
scores as labels, perhaps the simplest idea is to minimize similarity between
the output and scores. In~\cite{bayes-optimal-subset-ranking}, it was
established that minimizing the pointwise least-squares surrogate
\begin{align*}
  \phi(\vec{s}, y) = \sum_{j=1}^n {(s_j - y_j)}^2
\end{align*}
actually minimizes $1 - \text{NDCG}(\vec{s}, y)$ because we can upper bound
the latter by some multiple of the former. But this upper bound is coarse,
and the result also does not tell us if the surrogate is consistent.
